## Introduction

I really learned a lot from github and some excellent open source authors or video makers。

This is my first game engine and the last one as well of my undergraduate life.



It is a game engine based on opengl.

I don't know whether will it support DX11/12 or Vulkan Platform in the future,it depends...

The engine contents are as follows.

## Contents

### Renderer

### Editor

### Resources Management System

### Script System

### Physics
